The decoder also has 6 identical layers, but with an additional third sub-layer performing multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.\n\n**Attention Mechanism**\n\nThe model uses a Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism (Figure 2), which computes the dot products of queries and keys, divides by \u221adk, and applies a softmax function to obtain weights on values. This is faster and more space-efficient than additive attention.\n\n**Multi-Head Attention**\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function, the model uses Multi-Head Attention, which linearly projects queries, keys, and values h times with different learned projections (Figure 2).
