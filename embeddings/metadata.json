The decoder also has six identical layers, but with an additional third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.\n\nThe attention mechanism used is called Scaled Dot-Product Attention, which computes the dot products of the query with all keys, divides each by \u221adk, and applies a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values. This process is depicted in Figure 2 (left).\n\nMulti-head attention is also employed, which consists of multiple attention layers running in parallel (Figure 2, right). Each head has its own set of learned linear projections for queries, keys, and values, and the output values are concatenated and projected to obtain the final values.\n\n"
